# Lane-and-Vehicles-Detection
A computer vision software pipeline built on top of Python to identify vehicles in a video. • Computes the camera calibration matrix and distortion coefficients for distortion correction to raw images. • Uses color transforms, gradients, Sobel, HOG feature extraction on a labeled training set of images, Vehicles classifier and Linear SVM classifier. • Works as a pipeline on a video stream to create a heat map of recurring detection frame by frame to reject outliers and follow detected vehicles • Determines the curvature of the lane and vehicle position with respect to the center.
